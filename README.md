# Drum Corps International Analysis
## Project Summary
--- 
One of my favorite activities is Drum Corps International. It is best described as "marching music's major league" and has an extremely large fanbase around the world. Each corps compete in several competitions a year and are scored based on several factors including music, visuals, etc. The goal for this project was to scrape the scores provided on DCI's website, clean the data, and attempt to predict a winner based on previous years scoring. This project uses **BeautifulSoup** and **Pandas** in **Python** to scrape the scores, **SQL** to clean and explore the data, and **Tableau** to visualize the scores, trends, and predictions.
